## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Elias Hovdenes, a Master's student specializing in Machine Learning at the University of Bergen. Here, you'll find a few projects reflecting my journey through computer science.

I have experience in a variety of programming languages including Python, Java, SQL, and Haskell, and I am always exploring new technologies.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
