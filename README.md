## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Elias Hovdenes, a Master's student specializing in Machine Learning at the University of Bergen. Here, you'll find a few repositories that reflect my journey through computer science and software development.

Currently, my projects range from contributions to TC39, a fun PokÃ©mon hobby project, to a game I developed for school. I have experience in various programming languages, including Python, Java, SQL, and Haskell, and Iâ€™m always exploring new technologies.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
